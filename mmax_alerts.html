				<h2>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h2>
                <br>
                <p>MMAX Alerts is a set of email notification tools I contributed to at Criteo to efficiently inform account strategists of their client's technical issues and potential business opportunities. MMAX Alerts have been rolled out to account strategists, their managers, and analysts globally across different teams. Today, users of these notifications cover more than 50% of Criteo's revenue. </p>
                <br>
                <p> All works are automated using R. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Account strategists, managers, and anlaysts receive notifications via email everyday. Each email is personalized for its receiver.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>AS Alert</h2>
                <br>
                <p> When a client changes campaign settings or updates its product feed, it can be subject to various technical issues. Every morning, AS Alert implements health check on each account strategist's accounts and notifies him or her about issues they may need to fix. This automatic email has greatly improved account strategists' efficiency, especially for those manage more than 100 small accounts at once. </p>
                <br>
                <h4>How It Works</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Some details have been omitted for confidentiality. </p>
                <p>The underlying R code queries and checks the following components.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Budget Issue:</b> Campaigns whose budget is expected to run out within a week.</li>
                    <li><b>Paused Campaigns:</b> Campaigns that paused recently.</li>
                    <li><b>Product Feed Issues:</b> Various feed health check, such as feed import to quality issues.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Pitcher</h2>
                <br>
                <p>It is difficult for account strategists to keep track of tens of clients while timely preparing for market seasonality (Christmas, Black Friday, etc.). The goal of the Pitcher is to help them decide if they can pitch businesses to their clients by examining each account’s and its competitors’ KPIs. </p>
                <br>
                <h4>How It Works</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Some details have been omitted for confidentiality.</p>
                <p>The underlying R code queries and checks 4 components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>YoY Comparison</b>: did a a client have a higher Cost Per Click one year ago? </li>
                    <li> <b>Huge Influencer</b>: Monitor Cost Per Click by large accounts in a given market. If there is a more than 10 % increase in any one of them, flag the list of accounts with large cookie overlap.  </li>
                    <li> <b>Competitor Monitoring</b>: For each account, identify top 5 competitors by measuring its performance relative to others. Query expected spend of each client and its competitors for the last 2 weeks. If their trend lines start diverging noticeably, inform the account strategist in charge. </li>
                    <li> <b>KPI Trend</b>: Flag clients whose certain KPI <i>started</i> trending downward. </li>
                </ul>
